    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-base machine learning and data sience libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting wheter or not someone has heart disease basee on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modelling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement:\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came form the Cleaveland data from th eUCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "Also available on Kagge [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data?select=heart_disease_uci.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting wheter or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, prusue the project.\n",
